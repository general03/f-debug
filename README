# Debugging

## VSCode

You can use the "Run" command and configure the right file

## PDB

### General

Launch the command `python -m pdb file.py`
Use `next` to step up the debugger, from line 1 to line x

### Specific place

Put `pdb.set_trace()` to put breakpoint
Launch the command `python file.py`

```shell
> /home/david/debug/file.py(7)<module>()
-> comment = 'PDB end file'
(Pdb) print(comment)
PDB breakpoint
```
